## Feature-by-Feature Testing:

### Navigation 

The Navbar was the first feature tested. In the mobile design, it was important that it did not take up to much space, but rather just the right hand corner of the screen next to the header.  It is represented by a candelabra, which when touched opens a dropdown menu that provides quick and easy access to each page.

On large screens, the navbar is fully displayed with the names of each page.  The page names are responsive, and toggle to show which page is highlighted by the cursor.

The navbar is responsive and working as expected (with quick transitions between pages and links properly directed to the target page.  This was tested in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

### Footer

The footer is designed simply to provide quick access to the most desired social media and streaming platform pages for the band.  The icons all link to the proper pages, and do so in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.
